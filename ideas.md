# arf20's ideas to do

## software
- develop ww1game
- \*make arftracksat in moderngl and make a nice Qt interface for it
- retake arfOS (kernel), make a shell, write drivers -> most importantly figure out paging, allocation, protection, processes, filesystem and stuff
- rewrite my Z80 assembler, generate object files in some way, and make a separate linker
- make a smol C compiler, with assembly output, for x86 and Z80
- make Z80 simulator with hardware modules and cool graphics
- \*make a smol HTTP server bc yes
  - config in yaml?
  - file serving and CGI too
  - basic auth
- learn DSP stuff, which really is just doing stuff to complex arrays in oops; like PAL, FM, AM decoders etc
- SigDigger plugin- 
- \*arf file transfer server and client, ftp style, with gzip compression and TLS encryption
- arftalk, a chat that actually doesnt suck, super secure (TLS 1.3 and PGP) with multiple channel support (url style)
- WAV player- 
- video player with libavcodec or LibVLC, to SDL2- 
- video streaming TCP- 
- \*minesweeper in every graphic API i know (interchangable dynamic backen- ds)
- play with X11 Xlib stuff
	try doing a wm
	do a sort of remote control
	make a notepad lol
- 3D game (or you can't do that) in OpenGL? (pain) first map, then movement, then weapons, then enemies

- \*make a motherfucking CPU architecture, develop a two pass assembler for it, and a "simulator" in C
  - arfmipsas (MIPS...)
- develop a custom shitty language for it and a compiler
- make linux kernel modules, like a funny block device driver or smth
  - make a serial attached storage device (ttyUSB) with an arduino or raspi or smth
  - write a block device driver for it
  - write a fs driver for BRFS
- visualize fractional integration and differentiation

- take BatchDrake's SGDP implementation and make it a dynamic library and package it

- make a floppy drive controller with an arduino with a serial interface and make a linux block device driver for it

- \*LAN chat app with autodiscovery

- \*simple typesetting language and application for text paged text output (ESC/P output?)

- php arfchat client

- electric grid sim: simulate syncronous generator inertia and push back autosync

- mandelbrot or julia set in fragment shader

## HV
- spark gap transmitter
- spark gap tesla coil
- shit with MOTs

## radio
- replicate early receivers
  - coherer
  - magnetic hysteresis detector
  - electrolytic detector
  - galena crystal radio
- arrow 2m/70cm atenna
- SDR + raspi + antenna + powerbank backpack with websdr

## vaccuum
- build high vaccum chamber
  - cathode ray tube
  - x ray tube
  - fusor
